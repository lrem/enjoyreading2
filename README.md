=============

Maintenance fork of the Enjoy Reading addon by jblanche.
This, unlike the upstream, works with current Firefox versions.

XPI download (for installing in Firefox): <http://pub.lrem.net/2013/09/enjoy-reading-2.xpi>

The upstream: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/enjoy-reading/>

User review
-----------

The only one that got through before AMO took down the add-on:

Note
----
This is not in AMO for *good* reasons.
Seems that it is impossible right now to submit readability-based add-on.
The reply is broken down in the issues page.
**None of the problems have been introduced in this fork**.
