# enjoyreading2

Maintenance fork of the Enjoy Reading addon by jblanche.
This, unlike the upstream, works with current Firefox versions.

XPI download (for installing in Firefox): <http://pub.lrem.net/2013/09/enjoy-reading-2.xpi>

The upstream: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/enjoy-reading/>

## User review

The only one that got through before AMO took down the add-on:

> I've had bad eyes my whole life and reading various sites can be tricky
> for me. I think I've tried every other spawn-of-Readability addon
> available, but this one is the absolute best. Thank you so much for
> keeping it alive! It is something I use easily a dozen times every day and
> it improves the quality of my online life more than I can even express
> with words.

## Note

This is not in AMO for *good* reasons.
Seems that it is impossible right now to submit readability-based add-on.
The reply is broken down in the issues page.
**None of the problems have been introduced in this fork**.
